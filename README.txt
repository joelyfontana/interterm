Homework Assignment #1

#Overall
This homework assignment consists of practice problems 1,2,3 from chapter 1 and problems 2,4,6 from chapter 2.

#References
For problems 1,2 in chapter 1 and 2,4 in chapter 2 I worked with Stephen White to write and debug the programs. For problem 6 in chapter 2 I used google (specifically stackoverflow) to help me with the issues I encountered.

#Issues
Overall, the main issue I ran into was syntax. For several programs, I forgot semicolons and/or brackets, or they were misplaced. I also had brackets in the if else block which caused an error.

#Solutions
To solve these issues, I worked with Stephen White or used google to figure out the error.
