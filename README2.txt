Homework Assignment #2

#Overall
This assignment consisted of problems 1,5 from chapter 3, problems 2,4,11 from chapter 4, and problems 2,4 from chapter 5.

#References
In order to start some of the problems, I refered to the textbook. Further, I worked with Nikki Trippler and Stephen White to write the code for the programs.

#Issues
The biggest issue I encountered in this assignment was I continuously got a 0 returned in several of my programs. I also had some basic syntax errors and forgot to declare my functions before the main function.

#Solutions
To help me solve these problems, I consulted the all knowing google as well as reread the chapters in the book and worked together with Nikki Trippler and Stephen White.
